2. Presenting Problem
I feel anxious and avoid going back to the animal shelter because I believe the animals there will hate me for not remembering me. This leads to feelings of guilt and self-blame. These feelings started a few months ago after a visit to the shelter where some animals did not greet me as warmly as before.

3. Reason for Seeking Counseling
I decided to seek counseling because this issue has started affecting my daily life and my passion for working with animals.

4. Past History (including medical history)
I have not experienced similar problems before. I have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past. I do not have any significant physical illnesses.

5. Academic/occupational functioning level:
My job performance as a veterinary assistant has not been affected yet, but my passion for working with animals has dwindled. Interpersonal relationships: My relationships with other animal shelter volunteers have been strained as I have distanced myself because of this issue. Daily life: My anxiety about going to the shelter has disrupted my sleep patterns and overall well-being.

6. Social Support System
I have a few close friends who are supportive, but they do not fully understand the extent of my anxiety related to the animal shelter.`;
