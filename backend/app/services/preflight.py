"""
Pre-flight clinical validity check.

Rule-based gate that fires BEFORE drafts go to the clinician queue. It
flags drafts where the AI's chosen technique is clinically inappropriate
for the assessed severity, or where the response touches a known
contraindication / boundary issue.

Returns (pass: bool, reasons: list[str]) for each draft. A failing draft
is still stored (we don't drop content silently) but marked
`preflight_pass=False` and routed harder to clinician attention.
